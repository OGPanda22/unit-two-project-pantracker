# Technologies used in creating PanTracker!

The technologies I used to create this app are JS, CSS, HTML, nodemon, ejs, dotenv, express, express-session, method-override, morgan and mongoose.

# Next Steps

I would definitely like to mess around with the CSS a bit more. Plans to add a tab for a daily and weekly view of your tasks. Also plans for a tab to see all of the tasks you have completed using PanTracker.
